# Vyshyvanka Vibes

A sleek, responsive front-end template for an e-commerce site celebrating
Ukrainian embroidery ("vyshyvanka"), faithfully translated from a Figma design
into semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The web application is divided into the following sections:

- **Hero**: a full-width banner with a call-to-action
- **About**: information about the brand and its mission
- **Collection**: showcase of available vyshyvanka models
- **Order**: order form with input validation
- **Testimonials**: customer reviews

The site is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Custom `<load>` tags are
used to include partial HTML files from the `./partials/` directory.
